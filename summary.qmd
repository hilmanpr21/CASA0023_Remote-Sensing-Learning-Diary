# Summary


To wrap up, this learning diary was made with aims if in the future I come across remote sensing project, I can simply open this learning Diary.

Learn about remote sensing is really beneficial and fun because other than we learn about methodologies, we also learn about it's application on real world context.

The most interesting part is on the group project assignment because we have to change our academic oriented perspective to more client-facing perspective.
