            "abstract": "Remote sensing is a technique to observe the earth surface or the atmosphere from out of space using satellites (space borne) or from the air using aircrafts (airborne). Remote sensing uses a part or several parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. It records the electromagnetic energy reflected or emitted by the earth’s surface. The amount of radiation from an object (called radiance) is influenced by both the properties of the object and the radiation hitting the object (irradiance). The human eyes register the solar light reflected by these objects and our brains interpret the colours, the grey tones and intensity variations. In remote sensing various kinds of tools and devices are used to make electromagnetic radiation outside this range from 400 to 700 nm visible to the human eye, especially the near infrared, middle-infrared, thermal-infrared and microwaves.",

            "abstract": "This study aims to extract water surface area and lake surface water temperature (LSWT), and to present long-term spatio-temporal analysis of these variables together with meteorological parameters. Three lakes in Türkiye’s Lakes Region, namely, Lake Burdur, Egirdir, and Beysehir, were considered as test sites. The normalized difference water index (NDWI) was applied to Landsat 5 and 8 data from 2000 to 2021 to extract the water extent in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud-based platform. In addition to the lake surface area, Landsat thermal images were used to examine the LSWT. The findings indicated that water pixels could be extracted rather accurately using NDWI, with an overall accuracy of 98%. Between 2000 and 2021, the water surface area value of Lake Burdur decreased by more than 22%, while Lake Egirdir has dropped by less than 4%, and Lake Beysehir has not changed noticeably. LSWT of Burdur and Egirdir Lakes increased by more than 2.13 °C and 0.32 °C, respectively, while it decreased about 1.5 °C for Beysehir Lake. The obtained results were evaluated with meteorological parameters and our findings indicated that human-induced activities were more dominant than climate effects over Lake Burdur, unlike the others.",

            "abstract": "Landslide susceptibility prediction (LSP) has been widely and effectively implemented by machine learning (ML) models based on remote sensing (RS) images and Geographic Information System (GIS). However, comparisons of the applications of ML models for LSP from the perspectives of supervised machine learning (SML) and unsupervised machine learning (USML) have not been explored. Hence, this study aims to compare the LSP performance of these SML and USML models, thus further to explore the advantages and disadvantages of these ML models and to realize a more accurate and reliable LSP result. Two representative SML models (support vector machine (SVM) and CHi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID)) and two representative USML models (K-means and Kohonen models) are respectively used to scientifically predict the landslide susceptibility indexes, and then these prediction results are discussed. Ningdu County with 446 recorded landslides obtained through field investigations is introduced as case study. A total of 12 conditioning factors are obtained through procession of Landsat TM 8 images and high-resolution aerial images, topographical and hydrological spatial analysis of Digital Elevation Modeling in GIS software, and government reports. The area value under the curve of receiver operating features (AUC) is applied for evaluating the prediction accuracy of SML models, and the frequency ratio (FR) accuracy is then introduced to compare the remarkable prediction performance differences between SML and USML models. Overall, the receiver operation curve (ROC) results show that the AUC of the SVM is 0.892 and is slightly greater than the AUC of the CHAID model (0.872). The FR accuracy results show that the SVM model has the highest accuracy for LSP (77.80%), followed by the CHAID model (74.50%), the Kohonen model (72.8%) and the K-means model (69.7%), which indicates that the SML models can reach considerably better prediction capability than the USML models. It can be concluded that selecting recorded landslides as prior knowledge to train and test the LSP models is the key reason for the higher prediction accuracy of the SML models, while the lack of a priori knowledge and target guidance is an important reason for the low LSP accuracy of the USML models. Nevertheless, the USML models can also be used to implement LSP due to their advantages of efficient modeling processes, dimensionality reduction and strong scalability.",

            "abstract": "Smart growth policy has been identified as a panacea to tackle a range of undesirable outcomes of sprawl development. Various neighbourhood planning concepts have been developed following smart growth principles such as transit oriented development, and infill development. Existing empirical studies, however, do not answer to a key policy question: can smart growth policies reduce the urban heat island (UHI) effect? If so, what type of smart growth policy would be most effective? This research examined the questions by deriving five alternative neighbourhood planning scenarios for Brisbane for 2023: a) business as usual, b) transit oriented development (TOD), c) infill development, d) motorway corridor oriented development, and e) sprawl development. The research utilises Landsat remote sensing images of 1991, 2004, and 2013 to: first, estimate and validate a Geographically Weighted Regression model in order to identify statistically significant factors influencing the UHI intensities in Brisbane; and second, predict the UHI intensities of the five policy scenarios. Two factors were identified to have significant influence on the UHI intensities in Brisbane: population density, and porosity. Results show that compared to the 2004 and 2013 levels, Brisbane will respectively experience a higher and lower levels of UHI effect in 2023, irrespective of the policy scenarios. On average, the infill development scenario, as a smart growth policy, has a marginally better potential to mitigate the UHI effect in Brisbane in 2023 compared to the sprawl development scenario conditional on the definition applied in this research. The UHI effect would be more equitably balanced spatially under the sprawl development scenario.",

            "abstract": "Oil spill monitoring in remote sensing field has become a very popular technology to detect the spatial distribution of polluted regions. However, previous studies mainly focus on the supervised detection technologies, which requires a large number of high-quality training set. To solve this problem, we propose a self-supervised learning method to learn the deep neural network from unlabelled hyperspectral data for oil spill detection, which consists of three parts: data augmentation, unsupervised deep feature learning, and oil spill detection network. First, the original image is augmented with spectral and spatial transformation to improve robustness of the self-supervised model. Then, the deep neural networks are trained on the augmented data without label information to produce the high-level semantic features. Finally, the pre-trained parameters are transferred to establish a neural network classifier to obtain the detection result, where a contrastive loss is developed to fine-tune the learned parameters so as to improve the generalization ability of the proposed method. Experiments performed on ten oil spill datasets reveal that the proposed method obtains promising detection performance with respect to other state-of-the-art hyperspectral detection approaches.",

            "abstract": "The Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) shortwave infrared subsystem can acquire images of active fires during daytime and night-time from a polar orbit, providing useful data on fire properties at a nominal spatial resolution of 30 m. Binary fire/no-fire counts of ASTER pixels have also been useful in evaluating the performance of widely-used fire products from the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), which have a nominal spatial resolution of 1 km. However, the ASTER fire pixels are actually mixed pixels that can contain flaming, smouldering and non-burning components, and ASTER fire pixel counts provide no information about the sizes or temperatures of these subpixel components. This paper uses multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA) to estimate subpixel fire sizes and temperatures from a night-time ASTER image of a fire in California, USA, demonstrating new methods that can provide information on fires not available from other sources. As a fire’s size and its temperature exert strong influences on its gas and aerosol emissions, ecological impact and spreading rates, these MESMA estimates from ASTER imagery could contribute valuable new information towards monitoring, forecasting and understanding the behaviour and impacts of many fires worldwide.",

            "abstract": "The unprecedented availability of optical satellite data in cloud-based computing platforms, such as Google Earth Engine (GEE), opens new possibilities to develop crop trait retrieval models from the local to the planetary scale. Hybrid retrieval models are of interest to run in these platforms as they combine the advantages of physically-based radiative transfer models (RTM) with the flexibility of machine learning regression algorithms. Previous research with GEE primarily relied on processing bottom-of-atmosphere (BOA) reflectance data, which requires atmospheric correction. In the present study, we implemented hybrid models directly into GEE for processing Sentinel-2 (S2) Level-1C (L1C) top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance data into crop traits. To achieve this, a training dataset was generated using the leaf-canopy RTM PROSAIL in combination with the atmospheric model 6SV. Gaussian process regression (GPR) retrieval models were then established for eight essential crop traits namely leaf chlorophyll content, leaf water content, leaf dry matter content, fractional vegetation cover, leaf area index (LAI), and upscaled leaf variables (i.e., canopy chlorophyll content, canopy water content and canopy dry matter content). An important pre-requisite for implementation into GEE is that the models are sufficiently light in order to facilitate efficient and fast processing. Successful reduction of the training dataset by 78% was achieved using the active learning technique Euclidean distance-based diversity (EBD). With the EBD-GPR models, highly accurate validation results of LAI and upscaled leaf variables were obtained against in situ field data from the validation study site Munich-North-Isar (MNI), with normalized root mean square errors (NRMSE) from 6% to 13%. Using an independent validation dataset of similar crop types (Italian Grosseto test site), the retrieval models showed moderate to good performances for canopy-level variables, with NRMSE ranging from 14% to 50%, but failed for the leaf-level estimates. Obtained maps over the MNI site were further compared against Sentinel-2 Level 2 Prototype Processor (SL2P) vegetation estimates generated from the ESA Sentinels’ Application Platform (SNAP) Biophysical Processor, proving high consistency of both retrievals (R2 from 0.80 to 0.94). Finally, thanks to the seamless GEE processing capability, the TOA-based mapping was applied over the entirety of Germany at 20 m spatial resolution including information about prediction uncertainty. The obtained maps provided confidence of the developed EBD-GPR retrieval models for integration in the GEE framework and national scale mapping from S2-L1C imagery. In summary, the proposed retrieval workflow demonstrates the possibility of routine processing of S2 TOA data into crop traits maps at any place on Earth as required for operational agricultural applications.",

Despite the increasing interest among scientists in fields such as ecology, astronomy, health care, and land-use planning, light pollution lacks a current quantification of its magnitude on a global scale. To overcome this, we present the world atlas of artificial sky luminance, computed with our light pollution propagation software using new high-resolution satellite data and new precision sky brightness measurements. This atlas shows that more than 80% of the world and more than 99% of the U.S. and European populations live under light-polluted skies. The Milky Way is hidden from more than one-third of humanity, including 60% of Europeans and nearly 80% of North Americans. Moreover, 23% of the world’s land surfaces between 75°N and 60°S, 88% of Europe, and almost half of the United States experience light-polluted nights.",

Low earth orbiting passive microwave sensors provide unique information related to atmospheric moisture and precipitation, as well as surface properties such as oceanic wind speed. This paper will focus on two microwave sensors that are part of NOAA’s Joint Polar Satellite System-the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) and the Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS)-which are flown on Japan’s Global Change Observation Mission-Water (GCOM-W1) and the Suomi National Polar orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) satellites. The orbits of GCOM-W1 and S-NPP are such that AMSR2 and ATMS observe the same region of the earth nearly the same time of the day. This allows for comparison of similar products from the two sensors, which is of great interest to users such as NOAA’s National Weather Service. In this paper, we focus on product comparisons for a historic flooding event in the U.S. associated with Hurricane Joaquin. The microwave products are presented and shown with other widely used in-situ observations. The performance of AMSR2 and ATMS products are compared. The higher spatial resolution of the AMSR2 sensor provides more detailed information on water vapor and rain rate compared to ATMS. On the other hand, the wider swath width of the ATMS provides a more continuous field of water vapor and precipitation, as well as water vapor retrievals over land.",

            "abstract": "Drought as a complex event depends on some geo-environmental parameters. The impact of this phenomenon on the economy and environment can be devastating. Recognizing drought-prone regions is essential for planning and adopting mitigation measures. This study focused on introducing a multiscale method based on the satellite datasets to assess drought vulnerability in non-gage areas. In this regard, two steps were considered and drought monitoring was done for the northwest part of Iran as the study area. In the first step, vulnerable areas were identified using multi-criteria-kernel-based techniques which integrated 17 geo-environmental parameters extracted from the in-situ observations and satellite datasets to develop drought vulnerability map. The considered models were evaluated via different metrics and most important variables were determined by performing sensitivity analysis. Results indicated that the south and central parts of the selected area were more prone to severe droughts. Among the used variables, soil moisture, precipitation, evaporation, humidity, and vegetation condition were the most effective parameters. In the second step, due to limitations of the in-situ observations, drought-prone areas were identified using only precipitation, vegetation condition, and land surface temperature variables extracted from the satellites. For this aim, a new multi-scale method was developed based on the Wavelet Transform (WT), Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD), Permutation Entropy (HPE), and kernel-based methods. The obtained results showed the appropriate efficiency of the proposed multiscale method in identifying drought-prone areas with different intensity.",

            "abstract": "It is now widely accepted that climate change is occurring as a result of the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere arising from the combustion of fossil fuels. Climate change may affect health through a range of pathways, for example as a result of increased frequency and intensity of heat waves, reduction in cold related deaths, increased floods and droughts, changes in the distribution of vector-borne diseases and effects on the risk of disasters and malnutrition. The overall balance of effects on health is likely to be negative and populations in low-income countries are likely to be particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects. The experience of the 2003 heat wave in Europe shows that high-income countries may also be adversely affected. Adaptation to climate change requires public health strategies and improved surveillance. Mitigation of climate change by reducing the use of fossil fuels and increasing a number of uses of the renewable energy technologies should improve health in the near-term by reducing exposure to air pollution.",

            "abstract": "Over 70 percent of the population of the world’s developed countries live in urbanized areas. In developing countries migration to urban areas is continuing at an increasing rate. Detection and analysis of settlement patterns, estimating population, and monitoring population migration in a timely manner are requisite to accurately assess the impact of human activities on the environment. Monitoring urban land use change patterns is among the most critical information needs for future economic development planning, natural resource allocation, and environmental and ecosystem management. Previous research has demonstrated the potential of imaging radar systems in analyzing urban, population, and settlement phenomena. However, the variability and complexity within and between urban land use morphologies present a convoluted environment for analysis. Studies of vegetation, soils, geology, hydrology, and ice and snow have all received more attention and been the subject of considerably more widespread and in-depth radar research. Nevertheless, imaging radars offer some distinct advantages and opportunities for urban-based research. With the arrival of operational space imaging SAR systems, a review of the current status of applications of radar remote sensing in urban studies should be useful for focusing our attention on this important area of radar research and identification of specific problems for in-depth analysis. This paper traces the history of imaging radar research for urban, settlement, and population analysis. It presents a status report on the applications of SAR in settlement detection, population estimation, assessment of the impact of human activities on the physical environment, mapping and analyzing urban land use patterns, and interpretation of socioeconomic characteristics. The demonstrated capabilities and limitations of past and current imaging radar systems with reference to these applications are described. Potential avenues of future research are addressed.",

            "abstract": "Abstract A new index of calculating the intensity of urban heat island effects (UHI) for a city using satellite skin temperature and land cover observations is recommended. UHI, the temperature difference between urban and rural regions, is traditionally identified from the 2-m surface air temperatures (i.e., the screen-level temperature T2m) measured at a pair of weather stations sited in urban and rural locations. However, such screen-level UHI is affected by the location, distance, and geographic conditions of the pair of weather stations. For example, choosing a different pair of rural and city sites leads to a different UHI intensity for the same city, due to the high heterogeneity of the urban surface temperature. To avoid such uncertainty, satellite-observed surface skin temperature measurements (i.e., skin level temperature Tskin) is recommended to record UHI, known as skin-level UHI or UHIskin. This new index has advantages of high spatial resolution and aerial coverage to better record UHI intensity than T2m. An assessment of skin-level UHI from 10 yr of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)’s Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observations reveals that skin-level UHI has a strong UHI signal during the day and at night. In addition, there are significant diurnal and seasonal variations in skin-level UHI. Furthermore, the skin-level UHI is stronger during the day and summer (July) than during nighttime and winter. This new index is important for more uniformly assessing UHIs over cities around the globe. Nevertheless, whether the seasonality and diurnal variations revealed in this work using skin-level UHI index are valid over desert cities, such as Phoenix, Arizona, need to be examined.",

            "abstract": "Near real-time satellite-derived flood maps are invaluable to river forecasters and decision-makers for disaster monitoring and relief efforts. With support from the JPSS (Joint Polar Satellite System) Proving Ground and Risk Reduction (PGRR) Program, flood detection software has been developed using Suomi-NPP/VIIRS (Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership/Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) imagery to automatically generate near real-time flood maps for National Weather Service (NWS) River Forecast Centers (RFC) in the USA. The software, which is called VIIRS NOAA GMU Flood Version 1.0 (hereafter referred to as VNG Flood V1.0), consists of a series of algorithms that include water detection, cloud shadow removal, terrain shadow removal, minor flood detection, water fraction retrieval, and floodwater determination. The software is designed for flood detection in any land region between 80°S and 80°N, and it has been running routinely with direct broadcast SNPP/VIIRS data at the Space Science and Engineering Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW/SSEC) and the Geographic Information Network of Alaska at the University of Alaska-Fairbanks (UAF/GINA) since 2014. Near real-time flood maps are distributed via the Unidata Local Data Manager (LDM), reviewed by river forecasters in AWIPS-II (the second generation of the Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System) and applied in flood operations. Initial feedback from operational forecasters on the product accuracy and performance has been largely positive. The software capability has also been extended to areas outside of the USA via a case-driven mode to detect major floods all over the world. Offline evaluation efforts include the visual inspection of over 10,000 VIIRS false-color composite images, an inter-comparison with MODIS automatic flood products and a quantitative validation using Landsat imagery. The steady performance from the 3-year routine process and the promising evaluation results indicate that VNG Flood V1.0 has a high feasibility for flood detection at the product level.",

            "abstract": "Flood is defined as water that temporarily submerges land. In the United States, flood is being considered as an event only if it last over 72 hours, but the time frame is much longer in the Europe. The information of water bodies is an important source when examining floods. However, this data is not always available or accurate by traditional survey since water surface changes frequently. Remote Sensing provides an alternative method to traditional survey with lower cost and much frequent revisit cycles. Some sensors have very fine spatial resolution but relative long revisit circle; while some fine temporal resolution satellites are not able to provide spatial information in detail. This paper provides a brief review and comparison of major optical and Radar satellite sensors which are currently adopted in flood assessment. Result indicated that both optical sensors and Radar systems play important roles in flood assessment. Although many agencies use Radar or optical data independently when ding flood assessment, the potential of combining data from both systems is huge.",

Herein, multi-temporal Sentinel-2 images are incorporated with supervised machine learning algorithms in order to determine seven land use and land cover (LULC) classes. Pixel-based (PB) and object-based (OB) classification methods are also considered and evaluated. When using the PB approach combined with the random forest algorithms and median composited time-series data, results demonstrated that the highest attainment is achieved: namely, overall accuracy of 85.42% and kappa statistics reaches 0.82. Z-statistics confirm the potential of median composited datasets that provide significant performance (p-value <0.05). GEE reveals many advantages in geospatial analysis from this experiment. GEE is a robust cloud-serviced tool for LULC time-series image classification.",

            "abstract": "South Kalimantan Province is an area that has a very large forest area, but this forest continues to decrease due to deforestation. Deforestation continues to be one of the factors causing flooding. Flooding in this area is a recurring disaster that must be overcome. For this reason, it is necessary to calculate changes in forest area so that forest processing can be carried out properly and that banners can be overcome. In this study, the rate of deforestation was calculated using a map of land use change in South Kalimantan Province through the google earth engine platform using Landsat imagery. The method in this research is supervised classification, which is taking polygon samples in land use classification. The image classification algorithm with javascript on the google earth engine platform will classify the same pixel values into the same classification based on the samples that have been made. Through this platform, images in geo.tif format will be obtained. then the image is processed using ArcGIS software to process the image into a map and the area of each classification. This map was then overlaid between 2015, 2018, and 2020 to see the changes. Based on the results of the study, it was found that there was a change in land use, especially in the forest class and community plantations. Forests decreased to 311,255 hectares with a decreasing rate of 62,251 hectares every year, while community plantations increased by 328,858 hectares with an increase of 65,771 hectares every year.",

            "abstract": "The rapidly expanding urban areas of the world constitute an environmental challenge for the 21st century that requires both new analytic approaches and new sources of data and information. Management of the urban environment must consider phenomena at three scales, including the physical environment within cities, environmental systems consisting of cities and their regional hinterlands, and the environmental implications of the global network of megacities. Increasing availability of remotely sensed observations and a variety of other geospatial information could facilitate the development of new tools and approaches for understanding the urban environment. These new applications should take advantage of the special characteristics of remotely sensed data, including their broad spatial coverage, their capacity for routine and unobtrusive updating and their ability to provide self-consistent measurements of critical physical properties that would be difficult or expensive to obtain in situ. In many cases, using remote sensing data to measure and monitor urban environmental conditions will be more straightforward than using them for urban planning purposes, where traditional sources of governmental and private sector data are more easily obtained and understood. In developing countries, however, remote sensing may provide fundamental observations of urban growth and environmental conditions that are not available from other sources.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Milky seas are a rare form of marine bioluminescence where the nocturnal ocean surface produces a widespread, uniform and steady whitish glow. Mariners have compared their appearance to a daylit snowfield that extends to all horizons. Encountered most often in remote waters of the northwest Indian Ocean and the Maritime Continent, milky seas have eluded rigorous scientific inquiry, and thus little is known about their composition, formation mechanism, and role within the marine ecosystem. The Day/Night Band (DNB), a new-generation spaceborne low-light imager, holds potential to detect milky seas, but the capability has yet to be demonstrated. Here, we show initial examples of DNB-detected milky seas based on a multi-year (2012–2021) search. The massive bodies of glowing ocean, sometimes exceeding 100,000 km 2 in size, persist for days to weeks, drift within doldrums amidst the prevailing sea surface currents, and align with narrow ranges of sea surface temperature and biomass in a way that suggests water mass isolation. These findings show how spaceborne assets can now help guide research vessels toward active milky seas to learn more about them.",

            "abstract": "Information about the spatial distribution of urban surface emissivity is essential for surface temperature estimation. The latter is critical in many applications, such as estimation of surface sensible and latent heat fluxes, energy budget, urban canopy modeling, bio-climatic studies and urban planning. This study proposes a new method for improving the estimation of urban surface emissivity, which is primarily based on spectral mixture analysis. The urban surface is assumed to consist of three fundamental land cover components, namely vegetation, impervious and soil that refer to the urban environment. Due to the complexity of the urban environment, the impervious component is further divided into two land cover components: high-albedo and low-albedo impervious. Emissivity values are assigned to each component based on emissivity distributions derived from the ASTER Spectral Library Version 2.0. The fractional covers are estimated using a constrained least absolute values algorithm which is robust to outliers, and results are compared against the ones derived from a conventional constrained least squares algorithm. Following the proposed method, by combining the fraction of each cover component with a respective emissivity value, an overall emissivity for a given pixel is estimated. The methodology is applicable to visible and near infrared satellite imagery, therefore it could be used to derive emissivity maps from most multispectral satellite sensors. The proposed approach was applied to ASTER multispectral data for the city of Heraklion, Greece. Emissivity, as well as land surface temperature maps in the spectral region of 10.25–10.95μm (ASTER band 13) were derived and evaluated against ASTER higher level products revealing comparable error estimations. An overall RMSE of 0.014776 (bias=−0.01239) was computed between the estimated emissivity obtained using the proposed methodology and the ASTER higher level product emissivity (AST05). The respective overall RMSE value for derived LST was found equal to 0.816935K (bias=0.67826K).",

            "abstract": "In this paper, an ensemble method, which demonstrated efficiency in GIS based flood modeling, was used to create flood probability indices for the Damansara River catchment in Malaysia. To estimate flood probability, the frequency ratio (FR) approach was combined with support vector machine (SVM) using a radial basis function kernel. Thirteen flood conditioning parameters, namely, altitude, aspect, slope, curvature, stream power index, topographic wetness index, sediment transport index, topographic roughness index, distance from river, geology, soil, surface runoff, and land use/cover (LULC), were selected. Each class of conditioning factor was weighted using the FR approach and entered as input for SVM modeling to optimize all the parameters. The flood hazard map was produced by combining the flood probability map with flood-triggering factors such as; averaged daily rainfall and flood inundation depth. Subsequently, the hydraulic 2D high-resolution sub-grid model (HRS) was applied to estimate the flood inundation depth. Furthermore, vulnerability weights were assigned to each element at risk based on their importance. Finally flood risk map was generated. The results of this research demonstrated that the proposed approach would be effective for flood risk management in the study area along the expressway and could be easily replicated in other areas.",

With the advent of cloud computing platforms, time series feature extraction techniques, and machine learning classifiers, new opportunities are arising in more accurate and large-scale LULC mapping. In this study, we aimed at finding out how two composition methods and spectral–temporal metrics extracted from satellite time series can affect the ability of a machine learning classifier to produce accurate LULC maps. We used the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform to create cloud-free Sentinel-2 (S-2) and Landsat-8 (L-8) time series over the Tehran Province (Iran) as of 2020. Two composition methods, namely, seasonal composites and percentiles metrics, were used to define four datasets based on satellite time series, vegetation indices, and topographic layers. The random forest classifier was used in LULC classification and for identifying the most important variables. Accuracy assessment results showed that the S-2 outperformed the L-8 spectral–temporal metrics at the overall and class level. Moreover, the comparison of composition methods indicated that seasonal composites outperformed percentile metrics in both S-2 and L-8 time series. At the class level, the improved performance of seasonal composites was related to their ability to provide better information about the phenological variation of different LULC classes. Finally, we conclude that this methodology can produce LULC maps based on cloud computing GEE in an accurate and fast way and can be used in large-scale LULC mapping.",

            "abstract": "Lava fountains produced from explosive eruptions at Etna volcano are characterized by the development of several km high ash plumes and lava overflows from the crater rim. The formation of lava flows and tephra deposits and the dispersion of volcanic clouds have the potential to impact on population, aviation and infrastructure. For this reason, mapping and quantifying the areal extension of the products erupted is of great importance for forecasting volcanic hazards. The huge amount of multispectral satellite data provides new perspectives for the near real-time monitoring of volcanic hazards, which needs new machine learning (ML) techniques for the automatic process of data. Support Vector Machine (SVM) and satellite data have been shown can be used to track lava flows and volcanic clouds. Here, we show the potentiality of using SVM and satellite data with different spatial and temporal resolutions to fully characterize the volcanic products erupted during the lava fountain event occurred at Etna volcano on 10 February 2022. Two SVM models have been adopted using Google Earth Engine platform to map and quantify (a) the extension of the lava flows and tephra deposits, and (b) the volcanic cloud dispersed into the atmosphere. Exploiting the potentiality of machine learning and cloud computing to process satellite remote sensing data, we obtained a global quantitative analysis of products erupted during lava fountaining with a high accuracy level.",

This study developed and compared deep and shallow learning models for wetland classification across the climatically dynamic landscape of Alberta’s Parkland and Grassland Natural Region. This approach to wetland mapping entailed exploring multi-temporal (combination of spring/summer and fall months over 4 years—2017 to 202) and multisensory (Sentinel 1 and 2 and Advanced Land Observing Satellite, ALOS) data as input in the predictive models. This input image consisted of S1 dual-polarization vertical-horizontal bands, S2 near-infrared and shortwave infrared bands, and ALOS-derived topographic wetness index. The study explored the ResU-Net deep learning (DL) model and two shallow learning models, namely random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM). We observed a significant increase in the average F1-score of the ResNet model prediction (0.82) compared to SVM and RF prediction of 0.69 and 0.69, respectively. The SVM and RF models showed a significant occurrence of mixed pixels, particularly marshes and swamps confused for upland classes (such as agricultural land). Overall, it was evident that the ResNet CNN predictions performed better than the SVM and RF models. The outcome of this study demonstrates the potential of the ResNet CNN model and exploiting open-access satellite imagery to generate credible products across large landscapes.",

            "abstract": "Information about the spatial distribution of urban surface emissivity is essential for surface temperature estimation. The latter is critical in many applications, such as estimation of surface sensible and latent heat fluxes, energy budget, urban canopy modeling, bio-climatic studies and urban planning. This study proposes an estimation of urban surface emissivity, which is primarily based on spectral mixture analysis. The urban surface is assumed to consist of three fundamental land cover components, namely vegetation, impervious and soil that refer to the urban environment. Due to the complexity of the urban environment, the impervious component is further divided into two land cover components: high-albedo and low-albedo impervious. Emissivity values are assigned to each component based on emissivity distributions derived from the Landsat8. Following the proposed method, by combining the fraction of each cover component with a respective emissivity value, an overall emissivity for a given pixel is estimated. The methodology is applicable to visible and near infrared satellite imagery. Therefore it could be used to derive emissivity maps from most multispectral satellite sensors. The proposed approach was applied to Landsat8 multispectral data for the city of Darkhan-Uul, Mongolia. Emissivity, as well as land surface temperature maps in the spectral region of 10.6 - 11.2 &mu;m (Landsat8 band 10) and 11.5-12.5 (Landsat8 band 11) were derived.",

            "abstract": "This paper reviews the potential applications of satellite remote sensing to regional science research in urban settings. Regional science is the study of social problems that have a spatial dimension. The availability of satellite remote sensing data has increased significantly in the last two decades, and these data constitute a useful data source for mapping the composition of urban settings and analyzing changes over time. The increasing spatial resolution of commercial satellite imagery has influenced the emergence of new research and applications of regional science in urban settlements because it is now possible to identify individual objects of the urban fabric. The most common applications found in the literature are the detection of urban deprivation hot spots, quality of life index assessment, urban growth analysis, house value estimation, urban population estimation and urban social vulnerability assessment. The satellite remote sensing imagery used in these applications has medium, high or very high spatial resolution, such as images from Landsat MSS, Landsat TM and ETM+, SPOT, ASTER, IRS, Ikonos and QuickBird. Consistent relationships between socio-economic variables derived from censuses and field surveys and proxy variables of vegetation coverage measured from satellite remote sensing data have been found in several cities in the US. Different approaches and techniques have been applied successfully around the world, but local research is always needed to account for the unique elements of each place. Spectral mixture analysis, object-oriented classifications and image texture measures are some of the techniques of image processing that have been implemented with good results. Many regional scientists remain skeptical that satellite remote sensing will produce useful information for their work. More local research is needed to demonstrate the real potential and utility of satellite remote sensing for regional science in urban environments.",

            "abstract": "One of the first applications of satellite remote sensing imagery was to detect the size and shape of urbanized areas. Under many circumstances the mere identification of what is really urban is not clear. Smaller towns, diffuse development and varying degrees of spatial connectivity combined with the lack of an agreed upon definition of urban complicate the task. The proximity of urban development to spectrally similar fallow agricultural areas is a primary challenge of mapping urban development with satellite imagery. As sensors on satellites became more sophisticated and technically advanced, urban applications of remote sensing used higher spatial resolution imagery. However, moderate spatial resolution is widely used on non-urban applications because the synoptic spatial and retrospective temporal coverage is superior that offered by high resolution sensors. The most widely available imagery over the longest time period is provided by the Landsat missions. However, the 30 m spatial resolution of Landsat imagery combined with the spectral heterogeneity of urban land cover results in most urban areas being imaged as spectrally mixed pixels. Spectral mixture models may provide a physically based solution to the urban spectral heterogeneity because it is possible to reduce the dimensionality of the multispectral reflectance by converting it to areal fractions of land cover components, thus making interpretation easier. The spectral ambiguity of urban land cover is unavoidable but the challenge of mapping urban extent may be mitigated by using multiple sensors to image different characteristics of the urban environment. The present analysis was based on a three component linear mixture model incorporating substrate, vegetation and dark targets, directly used for visualization on false colour composites of red, green & blue respectively. Fraction composites suggest the location and extent of urban development - both at the periphery and within Sao Paulo’s urban agglomeration and its surroundings - but the spectral ambiguities with non-urban land cover remain a challenge. Winter and summer image pairs were selected for quality and consistency of solar illumination for two time intervals: 1986-2005 and 2000-2010. Changes over both time periods were quantified in terms of changes in endmember fractions. The results show increases of substrate, greater than 10% of the pixel area, with equivalent reduction of vegetation and/or shadow fractions. From these increases in substrate fraction, together with the presence of night lights of higher intensity and concentration, we infer an increase in urbanized land cover. A quantitative and visual analysis of these changes at different spatial scales is presented. Wide field synoptic imagery provided by the Defence Meteorological Satellite Program Operational Line Scanner (DMSP-OLS) indicates the presence of urbanized areas by imaging nocturnal lights. This sensor has been used by the Earth Observation group at NOAA NGDC to produce annual global composites of temporally stable nighttime lights since 1992. OLS night light imagery helps to differentiate non-urban substrate (i.e. exposed soil) from urbanized surfaces with different degrees of development, according to the intensity of the emitted light.",

It aims to identify a set of reference signatures (also known as endmembers) that can be used to model the reflectance spectrum at each pixel of the original image. Thus, the modeling is carried out as a linear combination of a finite number of ground components. Although spectral mixture models have proved to be appropriate for the purpose of large hyperspectral dataset subpixel analysis, few methods are available in the literature for the extraction of appropriate endmembers in spectral unmixing. Most approaches have been designed from a spectroscopic viewpoint and, thus, tend to neglect the existing spatial correlation between pixels. This paper presents a new automated method that performs unsupervised pixel purity determination and endmember extraction from multidimensional datasets; this is achieved by using both spatial and spectral information in a combined manner. The method is based on mathematical morphology, a classic image processing technique that can be applied to the spectral domain while being able to keep its spatial characteristics.

            "abstract": "ABSTRAK Kota Semarang merupakan salah satu kota terbesar di Indonesia, yang mempunyai tingkat rawan kebencanaan yang cukup tinggi. Beberapa bencana yang sering terjadi adalah banjir, banjir rob, tanah longsor dan kekeringan. Atas dasar kondisi tersebut, maka perlu dilakukan pemetaan multi bencana Kota Semarang sebagai salah satu upaya mitigasi bencana di Kota Semarang. Pemetaan multi bencana merupakan proses pembuatan peta yang memberikan gambaran potensi ancaman dari beberapa bencana, yaitu bencana banjir, banjir rob, tanah longsor dan kekeringan. Pemetaan multibencana Kota Semarang ini disusun denganmelakukan serangkaian tahapan yaitu membuat peta ancaman dari masing-masing bencana berbasis Sistem Informasi Geografis (SIG) kemudian digabungkan ( overlay ).Metodeyang digunakanadalahskoring danpembobotanserta overlay antarparameter penyusunnya menggunakan modifikasi rumusan penilaian risiko dari Peraturan Kepala Badan Penanggulangan Bencana Alam (PERKA BNPB) untuk mendapatkan klasifikasi ancaman multi bencana Kota Semarang. Penelitian ini menghasilkan wilayah dengan tingkat ancaman rendah seluas 18.522,061 Ha yang tersebar di 11 kecamatan, tingkat ancaman sedang seluas 16.359,561 Ha yang tersebar di seluruh kecamatan dan tingkat ancaman tinggi seluas 3.602,182 Ha, tersebar di delapan kecamatan. Tingkat kesesuaian antara hasil analisis dengan hasil validasi diperoleh nilai sebesar 52,841% untuk ancaman bencana banjir, 85,227% untuk ancaman bencana banjir rob, 86,932% untuk ancaman bencana tanah longsor dan 41,143% untuk ancaman bencana kekeringan.   Kata Kunci : Kota Semarang, Multi Bencana, Pemetaan, PERKA BNPB   ABSTRACT Semarang is one of the largest city in Indonesia who have high enough risk disaster level. There are several disaster  which usually occur such as flood, tidal flood,landslide and drought. Based on the condition,it  needs multi hazards mapping for Semarang city for disaster mitigation in Semarang city. Multi hazard mapping is the process of making map which give description the potential risk from disaster, such as flood, tidal flood,landslide and drought. Multi hazards map is made with series of steps which is make the hazard map from each disaster based on Geographic Information Systems (GIS), then overlay all of them. The methods of hazard map are scoring, weighting, and overlay between the compiler parameters, using the modification of risk estimation from rules of Indonesia National Disaster Management Authority Chief (PERKA BNPB) to classify the multi hazard of the Semarang city. This research obtains low hazard level area of about 18522,061 Hectare on 11 sub-districts, medium hazard level area about of 16,359.561 Hectare on all of sub-districts. And high hazard level area about 3,602.182 Hectare on eight sub-districts. Fitness level between the result analysis and validation was resulted value around 52.841% for flood hazard, 85.227% for tidal flood hazard, 86.932% for landslide hazard and 41.143% for drought hazard.   Keywords : :S emarang city, Multi hazard, Mapping, Rules of Indonesia National Disaster Management Authority Chief (PERKA BNPB) *) Penulis , PenanggungJawab",

            "abstract": "Abstract A recent NASA satellite is obtaining high spatial resolution thermal infrared data at times of day appropriate for, the study of the urban heat island effect. Quantitative estimates of the extent and intensity of urban surface heating are obtained by analysis of digital data acquired over the New York City–New England area. In many large cities satellite sensed temperatures are 10–15°C warmer than in surrounding rural areas. A thorough interpretation of the elevated urban surface temperature will require studies of 1) the relationship between remotely sensed surface temperatures and air temperatures, and 2) compensation for observed very localized heating due to industry and/or power plants.",

This work studies the use of the principal component analysis as a preprocessing technique for the classification of hyperspectral images. Two hyperspectral data sets, HYDICE and AVIRIS, were used for the study. A brief presentation of the principal component analysis approach is followed by an examination of the infor-mation contents of the principal component image bands, which revealed that only the first few bands contain significant information. The use of the first few principal component images can yield about 70 percent correct classification rate. This study suggests the benefit and efficiency of using the principal component analysis technique as a preprocessing step for the classification of hyperspectral images.",

Higher temperatures have a serious impact on the electricity consumption of the building sector increasing considerably the peak and the total electricity demand. The present paper aims to collect, analyze and present in a comparative way existing studies investigating the impact of ambient temperature increase on electricity consumption. Analysis of eleven studies dealing with the impact of the ambient temperature on the peak electricity demand showed that for each degree of temperature increase, the increase of the peak electricity load varies between 0.45% and 4.6%. This corresponds to an additional electricity penalty of about 21 (±10.4)W per degree of temperature increase and per person. In parallel, analysis of fifteen studies examining the impact of ambient temperature on the total electricity consumption, showed that the actual increase of the electricity demand per degree of temperature increase varies between 0.5% and 8.5%.",

            "abstract": "Several machine-learning algorithms have been proposed for remote sensing image classification during the past two decades. Among these machine learning algorithms, Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) have drawn attention to image classification in several remote sensing applications. This paper reviews RF and SVM concepts relevant to remote sensing image classification and applies a meta-analysis of 251 peer-reviewed journal papers. A database with more than 40 quantitative and qualitative fields was constructed from these reviewed papers. The meta-analysis mainly focuses on: (1) the analysis regarding the general characteristics of the studies, such as geographical distribution, frequency of the papers considering time, journals, application domains, and remote sensing software packages used in the case studies, and (2) a comparative analysis regarding the performances of RF and SVM classification against various parameters, such as data type, RS applications, spatial resolution, and the number of extracted features in the feature engineering step. The challenges, recommendations, and potential directions for future research are also discussed in detail. Moreover, a summary of the results is provided to aid researchers to customize their efforts in order to achieve the most accurate results based on their thematic applications.",

            "abstract": "Urban Heat Island (UHI) is a phenomenon that can cause hotspots in city areas due to dense, impervious infrastructure and minimal vegetation cover. UHI hotspots may become worse in extreme heat events that are already affecting many regions across the globe due to increased frequent hot extremes, human-induced warming in cities, and rapidly growing urbanization, as documented by the latest IPCC report 2021. In seeking to support designers, planners, and decision-makers in developing and implementing adaptation strategies and measures to make our cities sustainable and resilient, reliable projections and modelling are required. In this study, we modelled UHI vulnerability using high-resolution spatial data, advanced geospatial tools, and socio-demographic data. This modified vulnerability approach drew upon UHI index maps and 20 select customized indicators of heat exposure, population sensitivity, and mobility/adaptive capacity. The indicators were Delphi evaluated and weighted, and the methodology was applied against the City of Greater Geelong municipality in Australia. The resulting UHI index maps indicated significant hotspots in areas of high building density, commercial/industrial zones, newly constructed sites, and zones with low urban green infrastructure. These UHI maps, in combination with selected indicators, highlighted the areal concentration of heat risk areas and vulnerable locations for the sensitive human population. The highlighted areas were primarily concentrated in high building density and high population density areas, which was seen through correlation curves. However, the building density showed a weak correlation, and population per meshblock indicated a strong correlation with UHI measurements. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of risk mapping and vulnerability assessment using GIS geospatial data for the advancement of a major local government area and concludes that this methodology has replicability incomparable geographical regions.",

We have derived a global atlas of ALAN throughout the marine water column that will accelerate our understanding of its sources and environmental impacts. At a depth of 1 m, 1.9 million km2 of the world’s coastal seas are exposed to biologically important ALAN, which equates to around 3.1% of the global exclusive economic zones. This area decreases to 1.6 million km2 (2.7%) at a depth of 10 m, and to 840,000 km2 (1.4%) at 20 m. The most heavily exposed regions are those that experience intensive offshore development in addition to coastal urbanization. The atlas highlights that ALAN as a global change issue is not exclusive to land but is also widespread in the world’s underwater habitats at irradiances that elicit biological responses in marine organisms.",

Such strategies also can lower the demand for air-conditioning-related energy production. Since local impacts of global climate change may be intensified in areas with UHIs, mitigation strategies could play an increasingly important role as individuals and communities adapt to climate change. We use CITYgreen, a GIS-based modeling application, to estimate the potential benefits of urban vegetation and reflective roofs as UHI mitigation strategies for case study sites in and around Newark and Camden, New Jersey. The analysis showed that urban vegetation can reduce health hazards associated with the UHI effect by removing pollutants from the air. Less affluent, inner-city neighborhoods are the ones in which the hazard potential of the UHI effect is shown to be greatest. However, these neighborhoods have less available open space for tree planting and therefore a lower maximum potential benefit. As the climate warms, these neighborhoods may face greater consequences due to interactions between the UHI effect and global climate change. Results also show that urban vegetation is an effective and economically efficient way to reduce energy consumption and costs at the sites.",

It aims to identify a set of reference signatures (also known as endmembers) that can be used to model the reflectance spectrum at each pixel of the original image. Thus, the modeling is carried out as a linear combination of a finite number of ground components. Although spectral mixture models have proved to be appropriate for the purpose of large hyperspectral dataset subpixel analysis, few methods are available in the literature for the extraction of appropriate endmembers in spectral unmixing. Most approaches have been designed from a spectroscopic viewpoint and, thus, tend to neglect the existing spatial correlation between pixels. This paper presents a new automated method that performs unsupervised pixel purity determination and endmember extraction from multidimensional datasets; this is achieved by using both spatial and spectral information in a combined manner. The method is based on mathematical morphology, a classic image processing technique that can be applied to the spectral domain while being able to keep its spatial characteristics. The proposed methodology is evaluated through a specifically designed framework that uses both simulated and real hyperspectral data.",

            "abstract": "Urban flooding poses risks to the safety of drivers and pedestrians, and damages infrastructures and lifelines. It is important to accommodate cities and local agencies with enhanced rapid flood detection skills and tools to better understand how much flooding a region may experience at a certain period of time. This results in flood management orders being announced in a timely manner, allowing residents and drivers to preemptively avoid flooded areas. This research combines information received from ground observed data derived from road closure reports from the police department, with remotely sensed satellite imagery to develop and train machine-learning models for flood detection for the City of San Diego, CA, USA. For this purpose, flooding information are extracted from Sentinel 1 satellite imagery and fed into various supervised and unsupervised machine learning models, including Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC), to detect flooded pixels in images and evaluate the performance of these ML models. Moreover, a new unsupervised machine learning framework is developed which works based on the change detection (CD) approach and combines the Otsu algorithm, fuzzy rules, and iso-clustering methods for urban flood detection. Results from the performance evaluation of RF, SVM, MLC and CD models show 0.53, 0.85, 0.75 and 0.81 precision measures, 0.9, 0.85, 0.85 and 0.9 for recall values, 0.67, 0.85, 0.79 and 0.85 for the F1-score, and 0.69, 0.87, 0.83 and 0.87 for the accuracy measure, respectively, for each model. In conclusion, the new unsupervised flood image classification and detection method offers better performance with the least required data and computational time for enhanced rapid flood mapping. This systematic approach will be potentially useful for other cities at risk of urban flooding, and hopefully for detecting nuisance floods, by using satellite images and reducing the flood risk of transportation design and urban infrastructure planning.",

            "abstract": "With global warming forecast to continue into the foreseeable future, heat waves are very likely to increase in both frequency and intensity. In urban regions, these future heat waves will be exacerbated by the urban heat island effect, and will have the potential to negatively influence the health and welfare of urban residents. In order to investigate the health effects of the urban heat island (UHI) in Shanghai, China, 30 years of meteorological records (1975–2004) were examined for 11 first- and second-order weather stations in and around Shanghai. Additionally, automatic weather observation data recorded in recent years as well as daily all-cause summer mortality counts in 11 urban, suburban, and exurban regions (1998–2004) in Shanghai have been used. The results show that different sites (city center or surroundings) have experienced different degrees of warming as a result of increasing urbanization. In turn, this has resulted in a more extensive urban heat island effect, causing additional hot days and heat waves in urban regions compared to rural locales. An examination of summer mortality rates in and around Shanghai yields heightened heat-related mortality in urban regions, and we conclude that the UHI is directly responsible, acting to worsen the adverse health effects from exposure to extreme thermal conditions.",

            "abstract": "The energy balance differences between urban and rural areas give rise to a representative phenomenon of urban climate change called the urban heat island (UHI). The UHI phenomenon, which is exacerbated by global warming effects and urban expansion, exposes urban areas and populations to thermal stress and overheating. Therefore, measuring the intensity of UHI vulnerability is needed to mitigate its effects on health, comfort, energy consumption and infrastructure. Additionally, urban decision makers are looking for methodologies to identify the most vulnerable areas in urban planning. This research aims to investigate areas prone to urban overheating in Montpellier Mediterranean metropolitan area as a representative case study of the French urban planning context. The objective is to develop a methodology for assessing UHI vulnerability based on the interaction of exposure and sensitivity to urban planning policies. Accordingly, a set of fifteen indicators is developed to visualize urban planning policies, exposure and sensitivity to urban overheating. A statistical-based method is applied to determine the individual weights based on the indicators’ variance, which is calculated using principal component analysis (PCA). The spatial and urban planning distribution of vulnerability is then analyzed. The results indicate that the areas with the highest urban planning challenges are most vulnerable to UHI. In fact, the results reveal that these areas have urban planning characteristics likely to aggravate urban overheating. Therefore, this research proposes a methodology for integrating mitigation solutions into urban planning: increase in permeable and green areas; improvement of urban ventilation and heat exchange and decrease in anthropogenic heat generation. It demonstrates that combining urban planning policies with exposure and sensitivity is a new perspective for vulnerability studies. The findings of this study can be utilized by decision makers to better visualize areas susceptible to UHI and plan appropriate mitigation strategies.",

            "abstract": "This paper presents a survey of evolutionary computation theory for remote sensing image clustering. With the ongoing development of Earth observation techniques, remote sensing data has entered the era of big data, so it is difficult for researchers to get more prior knowledge. In recent years, many experts and scholars have a strong interest in remote sensing clustering due to it does not require training samples. However, remote sensing image clustering has always been a challenging task because of the inherent complexity of remote sensing images, the huge amount of data and so on. Normally, the clustering problem of remote sensing images is transformed into the optimization problem of fuzzy clustering objective function, the goal of which lies in the identification of correct cluster centers in the eigenspace. But traditional clustering approaches belong to hill climbing methods, which are greatly affected by initial values and easily get stuck in local optima. Evolutionary computation techniques are inspired by biological evolution, which can provide possible solutions to find the better clustering centers. So, researchers have carried out a series of related studies. Here, we provide an overview, including: (1) evolutionary single-objective; (2) evolutionary multi-objective; (3) memetic algorithm.",

            "abstract": "An accurate estimation of biomass burning emissions is partially limited by the lack of knowledge of fire burning phase (smoldering vs. flaming). In recent years, several fire detection products have been developed to provide information of fire radiative power (FRP), location, size, and temperature of fire pixels, but no information regarding fire burning phase is retrieved. The Day-Night band (DNB) aboard Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) is sensitive to visible light from flaming fires in nighttime scenes. In contrast, VIIRS 4 μm moderate resolution band #13 (M13), though capable of detecting fires at all phases, has no direct sensitivity for discerning fire phase. However, the hybrid usage of VIIRS DNB and M-bands data is hampered by their different scanning technology and spatial resolution. In this study, we present a novel method to rapidly and accurately resample DNB pixel radiances to the footprint of M-band pixels, accounting for onboard detector aggregation schemes and bowtie effect removals. The visible energy fraction (VEF) is subsequently introduced as an indicator of fire burning phase. VEF is calculated as the ratio of visible light power (VLP) to FRP for each fire pixel retrieved from the VIIRS 750 m active fire product. A global distribution of VEF values is quantitatively obtained, showing smaller VEF values in regions with mostly smoldering wildfires, such as peatland fires in Indonesia, larger VEF values in regions with flaming wildfires over grasslands and savannas in the sub-Sahelian region, and the largest VEF values associated with gas flaring in the Middle East. Mean VEF for different land cover types or regions is highly correlated with modified combustion efficiency (MCE). These results, together with a case study of the 2018 California Camp Fire, show that the VEF has the potential to be an indicator of fire combustion phase for each fire pixel, appropriate for estimating emission factors at the satellite pixel level.",

            "abstract": "The large area estimation of forest canopy closure (FCC) using remotely sensed data is of high interest in monitoring forest changes and forest health, as well as in assessing forest ecological services. The accurate estimation of FCC over the regional or global scale is challenging due to the difficulty of sample acquisition and the slow processing efficiency of large amounts of remote sensing data. To address this issue, we developed a novel bounding envelope methodology based on vegetation indices (BEVIs) for determining vegetation and bare soil endmembers using the normalized differences vegetation index (NDVI), modified bare soil index (MBSI), and bare soil index (BSI) derived from Landsat 8 OLI and Sentinel-2 image within the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, then combined the NDVI with the dimidiate pixel model (DPM), one of the most commonly used spectral-based unmixing methods, to map the FCC distribution over an area of more than 90,000 km2. The key processing was the determination of the threshold parameter in BEVIs that characterizes the spectral boundary of vegetation and soil endmembers. The results demonstrated that when the threshold equals 0.1, the extraction accuracy of vegetation and bare soil endmembers is the highest with the threshold range given as (0, 0.3), and the estimated spatial distribution of FCC using both Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 images were consistent, that is, the area with high canopy density was mainly distributed in the western mountainous region of Chifeng city. The verification was carried out using independent field plots. The proposed approach yielded reliable results when the Landsat 8 data were used (R2 = 0.6, RMSE = 0.13, and 1-rRMSE = 80%), and the accuracy was further improved using Sentinel-2 images with higher spatial resolution (R2 = 0.81, RMSE = 0.09, and 1-rRMSE = 86%). The findings demonstrate that the proposed method is portable among sensors with similar spectral wavebands, and can assist in mapping FCC at a regional scale while using multispectral satellite imagery.",

            "abstract": "Human civilization has an increasingly powerful influence on the earth system. Affected by climate change and land-use change, natural disasters such as flooding have been increasing in recent years. Earth observations are an invaluable source for assessing and mitigating negative impacts. Detecting changes from Earth observation data is one way to monitor the possible impact. Effective and reliable Change Detection (CD) methods can help in identifying the risk of disaster events at an early stage. In this work, we propose a novel unsupervised CD method on time series Synthetic Aperture Radar~(SAR) data. Our proposed method is a probabilistic model trained with unsupervised learning techniques, reconstruction, and contrastive learning. The change map is generated with the help of the distribution difference between pre-incident and post-incident data. Our proposed CD model is evaluated on flood detection data. We verified the efficacy of our model on 8 different flood sites, including three recent flood events from Copernicus Emergency Management Services and six from the Sen1Floods11 dataset. Our proposed model achieved an average of 64.53\\% Intersection Over Union(IoU) value and 75.43\\% F1 score. Our achieved IoU score is approximately 6-27\\% and F1 score is approximately 7-22\\% better than the compared unsupervised and supervised existing CD methods.

They also slow down a country’s economy. Due to the dynamic and complex nature of floods, it is difficult to predict the areas that are prone to flooding. In this study, an attempt was made to create a suitability map for future urban development based on flood vulnerability maps for the catchment area of Taif, Saudi Arabia. Three models were used for this purpose, including bivariate (FR), multivariate (LR), and machine learning (SVM) were used. Thirteen parameters were used as flood-contributing parameters. The inventory map was constructed using field surveys, historical data, analysis of RADAR (Sentinel-1A), and Google Earth imagery collected between 2013 and 2020. In general, 70% flood locations were randomly selected from the flood inventory map to generate the flood susceptibility model, and the remaining 30% of the flood locations were used for model validation. The flood susceptibility map was classified into five zones: very low, low, moderate, high, and very high. The AUC value used to predict the performance of the models showed that the accuracy reached 89.5, 92.0, and 96.2% for the models FR, LR, and SVM, respectively. Accordingly, the flood susceptibility map produced by the SVM model is accurate and was used to produce a flood vulnerability map with the help of urban and road density maps. Then slope and elevation maps were integrated with the flood vulnerability model to produce the final suitability map, which was classified into three zones: isolated zone, low suitability, and high suitability areas. The results showed that the highly suitable areas are located in the east and northeast of the Taif Basin, where the flood risk is low and very low. The results of this work will improve the land use planning of engineers and authorities and take possible measures to reduce the flood hazards in the area.",

            "abstract": "Urban heat islands are a clear, well-documented example of an anthropogenic modification to climate that has an atmospheric, biological, and economic impact. This review shows how field-based and modeling studies continue to help unravel the factors that are responsible for heat island development and are providing a basis for the development and application of sustainable adaptation strategies. As urban areas continue to expand, there is a heightened awareness that scientific knowledge of the urban heat island must be more effectively communicated to architects, engineers, and planners and translated into intelligent urban design. Green roof technology is a case in point. This and other technologies are being slowly adopted, and research published since 2003 suggests that the pace with which many practical applications are put into practice should accelerate.",

            "abstract": "Poverty has appeared as one of the long-term predicaments facing development of human society during the 21st century. Estimation of regional poverty level is a key issue for making strategies to eliminate poverty. This paper aims to evaluate the ability of the nighttime light composite data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Day–Night Band (DNB) carried by the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) Satellite in estimating poverty at the county level in China. Two major experiments are involved in this study, which include 1) 38 counties of Chongqing city and 2) 2856 counties of China. The first experiment takes Chongqing as an example and combines 10 socioeconomic variables into an integrated poverty index (IPI). IPI is then used as a reference to validate the accuracy of poverty evaluation using the average light index (ALI) derived from NPPVIIRS data. Linear regression and comparison of the class ranks have been employed to verify the correlation between ALI and IPI. The results show a good correlation between IPI and ALI, with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.8554, and the class ranks of IPI and API show relative closeness at the county level. The second experiment examines all counties in China and makes a comparison between ALI values and national poor counties (NPC). The comparison result shows a general agreement between the NPC and the counties with low ALI values. This study reveals that the NPP-VIIRS data can be a useful tool for evaluating poverty at the county level in China.",

            "abstract": "Climate models suggest that future anthropogenic warming can slow hurricane motion, including near populated midlatitude regions. , The locally accumulated damage by tropical cyclones (TCs) can intensify substantially when these cyclones move more slowly. While some observational evidence suggests that TC motion might have slowed significantly since the mid-20th century ( 1 ), the robustness of the observed trend and its relation to anthropogenic warming have not been firmly established ( 2 – 4 ). Using large-ensemble simulations that directly simulate TC activity, we show that future anthropogenic warming can lead to a robust slowing of TC motion, particularly in the midlatitudes. The slowdown there is related to a poleward shift of the midlatitude westerlies, which has been projected by various climate models. Although the model’s simulation of historical TC motion trends suggests that the attribution of the observed trends of TC motion to anthropogenic forcings remains uncertain, our findings suggest that 21st-century anthropogenic warming could decelerate TC motion near populated midlatitude regions in Asia and North America, potentially compounding future TC-related damages.",

            "abstract": "Nighttime light observations from remote sensing provide us with a timely and spatially explicit measure of human activities, and therefore enable a host of applications such as tracking urbanization and socioeconomic dynamics, evaluating armed conflicts and disasters, investigating fisheries, assessing greenhouse gas emissions and energy use, and analyzing light pollution and health effects. The new and improved sensors, algorithms, and products for nighttime lights, in association with other Earth observations and ancillary data (e.g., geo-located big data), together offer great potential for a deep understanding of human activities and related environmental consequences in a changing world. This paper reviews the advances of nighttime light sensors and products and examines the contributions of nighttime light remote sensing to perceiving the changing world from two aspects (i.e., human activities and environmental changes). Based on the historical review of the advances in nighttime light remote sensing, we summarize the challenges in current nighttime light remote sensing research and propose four strategic directions, including: Improving nighttime light data; developing a long time series of consistent nighttime light data; integrating nighttime light observations with other data and knowledge; and promoting multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary analyses of nighttime light observations.",

            "abstract": "The surface urban heat island (SUHI), which represents the difference of land surface temperature (LST) in urban relativity to neighboring non-urban surfaces, is usually measured using satellite LST data. Over the last few decades, advancements of remote sensing along with spatial science have considerably increased the number and quality of SUHI studies that form the major body of the urban heat island (UHI) literature. This paper provides a systematic review of satellite-based SUHI studies, from their origin in 1972 to the present. We find an exponentially increasing trend of SUHI research since 2005, with clear preferences for geographic areas, time of day, seasons, research foci, and platforms/sensors. The most frequently studied region and time period of research are China and summer daytime, respectively. Nearly two-thirds of the studies focus on the SUHI/LST variability at a local scale. The Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM)/Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+)/Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) and Terra/Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) are the two most commonly-used satellite sensors and account for about 78% of the total publications. We systematically reviewed the main satellite/sensors, methods, key findings, and challenges of the SUHI research. Previous studies confirm that the large spatial (local to global scales) and temporal (diurnal, seasonal, and inter-annual) variations of SUHI are contributed by a variety of factors such as impervious surface area, vegetation cover, landscape structure, albedo, and climate. However, applications of SUHI research are largely impeded by a series of data and methodological limitations. Lastly, we propose key potential directions and opportunities for future efforts. Besides improving the quality and quantity of LST data, more attention should be focused on understudied regions/cities, methods to examine SUHI intensity, inter-annual variability and long-term trends of SUHI, scaling issues of SUHI, the relationship between surface and subsurface UHIs, and the integration of remote sensing with field observations and numeric modeling.",
