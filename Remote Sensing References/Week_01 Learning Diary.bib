  abstract = {Over 70 percent of the population of the world’s developed countries live in urbanized areas. In developing countries migration to urban areas is continuing at an increasing rate. Detection and analysis of settlement patterns, estimating population, and monitoring population migration in a timely manner are requisite to accurately assess the impact of human activities on the environment. Monitoring urban land use change patterns is among the most critical information needs for future economic development planning, natural resource allocation, and environmental and ecosystem management. Previous research has demonstrated the potential of imaging radar systems in analyzing urban, population, and settlement phenomena. However, the variability and complexity within and between urban land use morphologies present a convoluted environment for analysis. Studies of vegetation, soils, geology, hydrology, and ice and snow have all received more attention and been the subject of considerably more widespread and in-depth radar research. Nevertheless, imaging radars offer some distinct advantages and opportunities for urban-based research. With the arrival of operational space imaging SAR systems, a review of the current status of applications of radar remote sensing in urban studies should be useful for focusing our attention on this important area of radar research and identification of specific problems for in-depth analysis. This paper traces the history of imaging radar research for urban, settlement, and population analysis. It presents a status report on the applications of SAR in settlement detection, population estimation, assessment of the impact of human activities on the physical environment, mapping and analyzing urban land use patterns, and interpretation of socioeconomic characteristics. The demonstrated capabilities and limitations of past and current imaging radar systems with reference to these applications are described. Potential avenues of future research are addressed.},

  abstract = {The rapidly expanding urban areas of the world constitute an environmental challenge for the 21st century that requires both new analytic approaches and new sources of data and information. Management of the urban environment must consider phenomena at three scales, including the physical environment within cities, environmental systems consisting of cities and their regional hinterlands, and the environmental implications of the global network of megacities. Increasing availability of remotely sensed observations and a variety of other geospatial information could facilitate the development of new tools and approaches for understanding the urban environment. These new applications should take advantage of the special characteristics of remotely sensed data, including their broad spatial coverage, their capacity for routine and unobtrusive updating and their ability to provide self-consistent measurements of critical physical properties that would be difficult or expensive to obtain in situ. In many cases, using remote sensing data to measure and monitor urban environmental conditions will be more straightforward than using them for urban planning purposes, where traditional sources of governmental and private sector data are more easily obtained and understood. In developing countries, however, remote sensing may provide fundamental observations of urban growth and environmental conditions that are not available from other sources.},

  abstract = {This paper reviews the potential applications of satellite remote sensing to regional science research in urban settings. Regional science is the study of social problems that have a spatial dimension. The availability of satellite remote sensing data has increased significantly in the last two decades, and these data constitute a useful data source for mapping the composition of urban settings and analyzing changes over time. The increasing spatial resolution of commercial satellite imagery has influenced the emergence of new research and applications of regional science in urban settlements because it is now possible to identify individual objects of the urban fabric. The most common applications found in the literature are the detection of urban deprivation hot spots, quality of life index assessment, urban growth analysis, house value estimation, urban population estimation and urban social vulnerability assessment. The satellite remote sensing imagery used in these applications has medium, high or very high spatial resolution, such as images from Landsat MSS, Landsat TM and ETM+, SPOT, ASTER, IRS, Ikonos and QuickBird. Consistent relationships between socio-economic variables derived from censuses and field surveys and proxy variables of vegetation coverage measured from satellite remote sensing data have been found in several cities in the US. Different approaches and techniques have been applied successfully around the world, but local research is always needed to account for the unique elements of each place. Spectral mixture analysis, object-oriented classifications and image texture measures are some of the techniques of image processing that have been implemented with good results. Many regional scientists remain skeptical that satellite remote sensing will produce useful information for their work. More local research is needed to demonstrate the real potential and utility of satellite remote sensing for regional science in urban environments.},

  abstract = {Poverty has appeared as one of the long-term predicaments facing development of human society during the 21st century. Estimation of regional poverty level is a key issue for making strategies to eliminate poverty. This paper aims to evaluate the ability of the nighttime light composite data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Day–Night Band (DNB) carried by the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) Satellite in estimating poverty at the county level in China. Two major experiments are involved in this study, which include 1) 38 counties of Chongqing city and 2) 2856 counties of China. The first experiment takes Chongqing as an example and combines 10 socioeconomic variables into an integrated poverty index (IPI). IPI is then used as a reference to validate the accuracy of poverty evaluation using the average light index (ALI) derived from NPPVIIRS data. Linear regression and comparison of the class ranks have been employed to verify the correlation between ALI and IPI. The results show a good correlation between IPI and ALI, with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.8554, and the class ranks of IPI and API show relative closeness at the county level. The second experiment examines all counties in China and makes a comparison between ALI values and national poor counties (NPC). The comparison result shows a general agreement between the NPC and the counties with low ALI values. This study reveals that the NPP-VIIRS data can be a useful tool for evaluating poverty at the county level in China.},

  abstract = {Nighttime light observations from remote sensing provide us with a timely and spatially explicit measure of human activities, and therefore enable a host of applications such as tracking urbanization and socioeconomic dynamics, evaluating armed conflicts and disasters, investigating fisheries, assessing greenhouse gas emissions and energy use, and analyzing light pollution and health effects. The new and improved sensors, algorithms, and products for nighttime lights, in association with other Earth observations and ancillary data (e.g., geo-located big data), together offer great potential for a deep understanding of human activities and related environmental consequences in a changing world. This paper reviews the advances of nighttime light sensors and products and examines the contributions of nighttime light remote sensing to perceiving the changing world from two aspects (i.e., human activities and environmental changes). Based on the historical review of the advances in nighttime light remote sensing, we summarize the challenges in current nighttime light remote sensing research and propose four strategic directions, including: Improving nighttime light data; developing a long time series of consistent nighttime light data; integrating nighttime light observations with other data and knowledge; and promoting multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary analyses of nighttime light observations.},

  abstract = {The surface urban heat island (SUHI), which represents the difference of land surface temperature (LST) in urban relativity to neighboring non-urban surfaces, is usually measured using satellite LST data. Over the last few decades, advancements of remote sensing along with spatial science have considerably increased the number and quality of SUHI studies that form the major body of the urban heat island (UHI) literature. This paper provides a systematic review of satellite-based SUHI studies, from their origin in 1972 to the present. We find an exponentially increasing trend of SUHI research since 2005, with clear preferences for geographic areas, time of day, seasons, research foci, and platforms/sensors. The most frequently studied region and time period of research are China and summer daytime, respectively. Nearly two-thirds of the studies focus on the SUHI/LST variability at a local scale. The Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM)/Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+)/Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) and Terra/Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) are the two most commonly-used satellite sensors and account for about 78\% of the total publications. We systematically reviewed the main satellite/sensors, methods, key findings, and challenges of the SUHI research. Previous studies confirm that the large spatial (local to global scales) and temporal (diurnal, seasonal, and inter-annual) variations of SUHI are contributed by a variety of factors such as impervious surface area, vegetation cover, landscape structure, albedo, and climate. However, applications of SUHI research are largely impeded by a series of data and methodological limitations. Lastly, we propose key potential directions and opportunities for future efforts. Besides improving the quality and quantity of LST data, more attention should be focused on understudied regions/cities, methods to examine SUHI intensity, inter-annual variability and long-term trends of SUHI, scaling issues of SUHI, the relationship between surface and subsurface UHIs, and the integration of remote sensing with field observations and numeric modeling.},
