  abstract = {Landslide susceptibility prediction (LSP) has been widely and effectively implemented by machine learning (ML) models based on remote sensing (RS) images and Geographic Information System (GIS). However, comparisons of the applications of ML models for LSP from the perspectives of supervised machine learning (SML) and unsupervised machine learning (USML) have not been explored. Hence, this study aims to compare the LSP performance of these SML and USML models, thus further to explore the advantages and disadvantages of these ML models and to realize a more accurate and reliable LSP result. Two representative SML models (support vector machine (SVM) and CHi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID)) and two representative USML models (K-means and Kohonen models) are respectively used to scientifically predict the landslide susceptibility indexes, and then these prediction results are discussed. Ningdu County with 446 recorded landslides obtained through field investigations is introduced as case study. A total of 12 conditioning factors are obtained through procession of Landsat TM 8 images and high-resolution aerial images, topographical and hydrological spatial analysis of Digital Elevation Modeling in GIS software, and government reports. The area value under the curve of receiver operating features (AUC) is applied for evaluating the prediction accuracy of SML models, and the frequency ratio (FR) accuracy is then introduced to compare the remarkable prediction performance differences between SML and USML models. Overall, the receiver operation curve (ROC) results show that the AUC of the SVM is 0.892 and is slightly greater than the AUC of the CHAID model (0.872). The FR accuracy results show that the SVM model has the highest accuracy for LSP (77.80\%), followed by the CHAID model (74.50\%), the Kohonen model (72.8\%) and the K-means model (69.7\%), which indicates that the SML models can reach considerably better prediction capability than the USML models. It can be concluded that selecting recorded landslides as prior knowledge to train and test the LSP models is the key reason for the higher prediction accuracy of the SML models, while the lack of a priori knowledge and target guidance is an important reason for the low LSP accuracy of the USML models. Nevertheless, the USML models can also be used to implement LSP due to their advantages of efficient modeling processes, dimensionality reduction and strong scalability.},

  abstract = {Oil spill monitoring in remote sensing field has become a very popular technology to detect the spatial distribution of polluted regions. However, previous studies mainly focus on the supervised detection technologies, which requires a large number of high-quality training set. To solve this problem, we propose a self-supervised learning method to learn the deep neural network from unlabelled hyperspectral data for oil spill detection, which consists of three parts: data augmentation, unsupervised deep feature learning, and oil spill detection network. First, the original image is augmented with spectral and spatial transformation to improve robustness of the self-supervised model. Then, the deep neural networks are trained on the augmented data without label information to produce the high-level semantic features. Finally, the pre-trained parameters are transferred to establish a neural network classifier to obtain the detection result, where a contrastive loss is developed to fine-tune the learned parameters so as to improve the generalization ability of the proposed method. Experiments performed on ten oil spill datasets reveal that the proposed method obtains promising detection performance with respect to other state-of-the-art hyperspectral detection approaches.},

  abstract = {Drought as a complex event depends on some geo-environmental parameters. The impact of this phenomenon on the economy and environment can be devastating. Recognizing drought-prone regions is essential for planning and adopting mitigation measures. This study focused on introducing a multiscale method based on the satellite datasets to assess drought vulnerability in non-gage areas. In this regard, two steps were considered and drought monitoring was done for the northwest part of Iran as the study area. In the first step, vulnerable areas were identified using multi-criteria-kernel-based techniques which integrated 17 geo-environmental parameters extracted from the in-situ observations and satellite datasets to develop drought vulnerability map. The considered models were evaluated via different metrics and most important variables were determined by performing sensitivity analysis. Results indicated that the south and central parts of the selected area were more prone to severe droughts. Among the used variables, soil moisture, precipitation, evaporation, humidity, and vegetation condition were the most effective parameters. In the second step, due to limitations of the in-situ observations, drought-prone areas were identified using only precipitation, vegetation condition, and land surface temperature variables extracted from the satellites. For this aim, a new multi-scale method was developed based on the Wavelet Transform (WT), Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD), Permutation Entropy (HPE), and kernel-based methods. The obtained results showed the appropriate efficiency of the proposed multiscale method in identifying drought-prone areas with different intensity.},

  abstract = {South Kalimantan Province is an area that has a very large forest area, but this forest continues to decrease due to deforestation. Deforestation continues to be one of the factors causing flooding. Flooding in this area is a recurring disaster that must be overcome. For this reason, it is necessary to calculate changes in forest area so that forest processing can be carried out properly and that banners can be overcome. In this study, the rate of deforestation was calculated using a map of land use change in South Kalimantan Province through the google earth engine platform using Landsat imagery. The method in this research is supervised classification, which is taking polygon samples in land use classification. The image classification algorithm with javascript on the google earth engine platform will classify the same pixel values into the same classification based on the samples that have been made. Through this platform, images in geo.tif format will be obtained. then the image is processed using ArcGIS software to process the image into a map and the area of each classification. This map was then overlaid between 2015, 2018, and 2020 to see the changes. Based on the results of the study, it was found that there was a change in land use, especially in the forest class and community plantations. Forests decreased to 311,255 hectares with a decreasing rate of 62,251 hectares every year, while community plantations increased by 328,858 hectares with an increase of 65,771 hectares every year.},

  abstract = {In this paper, an ensemble method, which demonstrated efficiency in GIS based flood modeling, was used to create flood probability indices for the Damansara River catchment in Malaysia. To estimate flood probability, the frequency ratio (FR) approach was combined with support vector machine (SVM) using a radial basis function kernel. Thirteen flood conditioning parameters, namely, altitude, aspect, slope, curvature, stream power index, topographic wetness index, sediment transport index, topographic roughness index, distance from river, geology, soil, surface runoff, and land use/cover (LULC), were selected. Each class of conditioning factor was weighted using the FR approach and entered as input for SVM modeling to optimize all the parameters. The flood hazard map was produced by combining the flood probability map with flood-triggering factors such as; averaged daily rainfall and flood inundation depth. Subsequently, the hydraulic 2D high-resolution sub-grid model (HRS) was applied to estimate the flood inundation depth. Furthermore, vulnerability weights were assigned to each element at risk based on their importance. Finally flood risk map was generated. The results of this research demonstrated that the proposed approach would be effective for flood risk management in the study area along the expressway and could be easily replicated in other areas.},

The formation of lava flows and tephra deposits and the dispersion of volcanic clouds have the potential to impact on population, aviation and infrastructure. For this reason, mapping and quantifying the areal extension of the products erupted is of great importance for forecasting volcanic hazards. The huge amount of multispectral satellite data provides new perspectives for the near real-time monitoring of volcanic hazards, which needs new machine learning (ML) techniques for the automatic process of data. Support Vector Machine (SVM) and satellite data have been shown can be used to track lava flows and volcanic clouds. Here, we show the potentiality of using SVM and satellite data with different spatial and temporal resolutions to fully characterize the volcanic products erupted during the lava fountain event occurred at Etna volcano on 10 February 2022. Two SVM models have been adopted using Google Earth Engine platform to map and quantify (a) the extension of the lava flows and tephra deposits, and (b) the volcanic cloud dispersed into the atmosphere. Exploiting the potentiality of machine learning and cloud computing to process satellite remote sensing data, we obtained a global quantitative analysis of products erupted during lava fountaining with a high accuracy level.},

  abstract = {Urban flooding poses risks to the safety of drivers and pedestrians, and damages infrastructures and lifelines. It is important to accommodate cities and local agencies with enhanced rapid flood detection skills and tools to better understand how much flooding a region may experience at a certain period of time. This results in flood management orders being announced in a timely manner, allowing residents and drivers to preemptively avoid flooded areas. This research combines information received from ground observed data derived from road closure reports from the police department, with remotely sensed satellite imagery to develop and train machine-learning models for flood detection for the City of San Diego, CA, USA. For this purpose, flooding information are extracted from Sentinel 1 satellite imagery and fed into various supervised and unsupervised machine learning models, including Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC), to detect flooded pixels in images and evaluate the performance of these ML models. Moreover, a new unsupervised machine learning framework is developed which works based on the change detection (CD) approach and combines the Otsu algorithm, fuzzy rules, and iso-clustering methods for urban flood detection. Results from the performance evaluation of RF, SVM, MLC and CD models show 0.53, 0.85, 0.75 and 0.81 precision measures, 0.9, 0.85, 0.85 and 0.9 for recall values, 0.67, 0.85, 0.79 and 0.85 for the F1-score, and 0.69, 0.87, 0.83 and 0.87 for the accuracy measure, respectively, for each model. In conclusion, the new unsupervised flood image classification and detection method offers better performance with the least required data and computational time for enhanced rapid flood mapping. This systematic approach will be potentially useful for other cities at risk of urban flooding, and hopefully for detecting nuisance floods, by using satellite images and reducing the flood risk of transportation design and urban infrastructure planning.},

With the ongoing development of Earth observation techniques, remote sensing data has entered the era of big data, so it is difficult for researchers to get more prior knowledge. In recent years, many experts and scholars have a strong interest in remote sensing clustering due to it does not require training samples. However, remote sensing image clustering has always been a challenging task because of the inherent complexity of remote sensing images, the huge amount of data and so on. Normally, the clustering problem of remote sensing images is transformed into the optimization problem of fuzzy clustering objective function, the goal of which lies in the identification of correct cluster centers in the eigenspace. But traditional clustering approaches belong to hill climbing methods, which are greatly affected by initial values and easily get stuck in local optima. Evolutionary computation techniques are inspired by biological evolution, which can provide possible solutions to find the better clustering centers. So, researchers have carried out a series of related studies. Here, we provide an overview, including: (1) evolutionary single-objective; (2) evolutionary multi-objective; (3) memetic algorithm.},

Affected by climate change and land-use change, natural disasters such as flooding have been increasing in recent years. Earth observations are an invaluable source for assessing and mitigating negative impacts. Detecting changes from Earth observation data is one way to monitor the possible impact. Effective and reliable Change Detection (CD) methods can help in identifying the risk of disaster events at an early stage. In this work, we propose a novel unsupervised CD method on time series Synthetic Aperture Radar\textasciitilde (SAR) data. Our proposed method is a probabilistic model trained with unsupervised learning techniques, reconstruction, and contrastive learning. The change map is generated with the help of the distribution difference between pre-incident and post-incident data. Our proposed CD model is evaluated on flood detection data. We verified the efficacy of our model on 8 different flood sites, including three recent flood events from Copernicus Emergency Management Services and six from the Sen1Floods11 dataset. Our proposed model achieved an average of 64.53\textbackslash\% Intersection Over Union(IoU) value and 75.43\textbackslash\% F1 score. Our achieved IoU score is approximately 6-27\textbackslash\% and F1 score is approximately 7-22\textbackslash\% better than the compared unsupervised and supervised existing CD methods. The results and extensive discussion presented in the study show the effectiveness of the proposed unsupervised CD method.},

Due to the dynamic and complex nature of floods, it is difficult to predict the areas that are prone to flooding. In this study, an attempt was made to create a suitability map for future urban development based on flood vulnerability maps for the catchment area of Taif, Saudi Arabia. Three models were used for this purpose, including bivariate (FR), multivariate (LR), and machine learning (SVM) were used. Thirteen parameters were used as flood-contributing parameters. The inventory map was constructed using field surveys, historical data, analysis of RADAR (Sentinel-1A), and Google Earth imagery collected between 2013 and 2020. In general, 70\% flood locations were randomly selected from the flood inventory map to generate the flood susceptibility model, and the remaining 30\% of the flood locations were used for model validation. The flood susceptibility map was classified into five zones: very low, low, moderate, high, and very high. The AUC value used to predict the performance of the models showed that the accuracy reached 89.5, 92.0, and 96.2\% for the models FR, LR, and SVM, respectively. Accordingly, the flood susceptibility map produced by the SVM model is accurate and was used to produce a flood vulnerability map with the help of urban and road density maps. Then slope and elevation maps were integrated with the flood vulnerability model to produce the final suitability map, which was classified into three zones: isolated zone, low suitability, and high suitability areas. The results showed that the highly suitable areas are located in the east and northeast of the Taif Basin, where the flood risk is low and very low. The results of this work will improve the land use planning of engineers and authorities and take possible measures to reduce the flood hazards in the area.},

The inventory map was constructed using field surveys, historical data, analysis of RADAR (Sentinel-1A), and Google Earth imagery collected between 2013 and 2020. In general, 70\% flood locations were randomly selected from the flood inventory map to generate the flood susceptibility model, and the remaining 30\% of the flood locations were used for model validation. The flood susceptibility map was classified into five zones: very low, low, moderate, high, and very high. The AUC value used to predict the performance of the models showed that the accuracy reached 89.5, 92.0, and 96.2\% for the models FR, LR, and SVM, respectively. Accordingly, the flood susceptibility map produced by the SVM model is accurate and was used to produce a flood vulnerability map with the help of urban and road density maps. Then slope and elevation maps were integrated with the flood vulnerability model to produce the final suitability map, which was classified into three zones: isolated zone, low suitability, and high suitability areas. The results showed that the highly suitable areas are located in the east and northeast of the Taif Basin, where the flood risk is low and very low. The results of this work will improve the land use planning of engineers and authorities and take possible measures to reduce the flood hazards in the area.},
