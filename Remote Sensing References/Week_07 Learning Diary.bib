  abstract = {The Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) shortwave infrared subsystem can acquire images of active fires during daytime and night-time from a polar orbit, providing useful data on fire properties at a nominal spatial resolution of 30 m. Binary fire/no-fire counts of ASTER pixels have also been useful in evaluating the performance of widely-used fire products from the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), which have a nominal spatial resolution of 1 km. However, the ASTER fire pixels are actually mixed pixels that can contain flaming, smouldering and non-burning components, and ASTER fire pixel counts provide no information about the sizes or temperatures of these subpixel components. This paper uses multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA) to estimate subpixel fire sizes and temperatures from a night-time ASTER image of a fire in California, USA, demonstrating new methods that can provide information on fires not available from other sources. As a fire's size and its temperature exert strong influences on its gas and aerosol emissions, ecological impact and spreading rates, these MESMA estimates from ASTER imagery could contribute valuable new information towards monitoring, forecasting and understanding the behaviour and impacts of many fires worldwide.},

On this case the residual is zero. Source: (19, p. 27). As mentioned, it is possible to use Linear Spectral Unmixing with imagery such as generated by Landsat 5 \& 7 satellites. As a result, the pixel values of these images indicate the fraction of the pixel that contains the endmember material corresponding to that image. For example a pixel from the \#1 Profusion image with a value of 0.45 indicates that 45\% of the pixel contains endmember from publication: IDENTIFYING MULTI-DECADAL CHANGES OF THE SAO PAULO URBAN AGGLOMERATION WITH MIXED REMOTE SENSING TECHNIQUES: SPECTRAL MIXTURE ANALYSIS AND NIGHT LIGHTS | One of the first applications of satellite remote sensing imagery was to detect the size and shape of urbanized areas.

  abstract = {Information about the spatial distribution of urban surface emissivity is essential for surface temperature estimation. The latter is critical in many applications, such as estimation of surface sensible and latent heat fluxes, energy budget, urban canopy modeling, bio-climatic studies and urban planning. This study proposes a new method for improving the estimation of urban surface emissivity, which is primarily based on spectral mixture analysis. The urban surface is assumed to consist of three fundamental land cover components, namely vegetation, impervious and soil that refer to the urban environment. Due to the complexity of the urban environment, the impervious component is further divided into two land cover components: high-albedo and low-albedo impervious. Emissivity values are assigned to each component based on emissivity distributions derived from the ASTER Spectral Library Version 2.0. The fractional covers are estimated using a constrained least absolute values algorithm which is robust to outliers, and results are compared against the ones derived from a conventional constrained least squares algorithm. Following the proposed method, by combining the fraction of each cover component with a respective emissivity value, an overall emissivity for a given pixel is estimated. The methodology is applicable to visible and near infrared satellite imagery, therefore it could be used to derive emissivity maps from most multispectral satellite sensors. The proposed approach was applied to ASTER multispectral data for the city of Heraklion, Greece. Emissivity, as well as land surface temperature maps in the spectral region of 10.25–10.95μm (ASTER band 13) were derived and evaluated against ASTER higher level products revealing comparable error estimations. An overall RMSE of 0.014776 (bias=−0.01239) was computed between the estimated emissivity obtained using the proposed methodology and the ASTER higher level product emissivity (AST05). The respective overall RMSE value for derived LST was found equal to 0.816935K (bias=0.67826K).},
