  abstract = {The availability of hyperspectral images expands the capability of using image classification to study detailed characteristics of objects, but at a cost of having to deal with huge data sets. This work studies the use of the principal component analysis as a preprocessing technique for the classification of hyperspectral images. Two hyperspectral data sets, HYDICE and AVIRIS, were used for the study. A brief presentation of the principal component analysis approach is followed by an examination of the infor-mation contents of the principal component image bands, which revealed that only the first few bands contain significant information. The use of the first few principal component images can yield about 70 percent correct classification rate. This study suggests the benefit and efficiency of using the principal component analysis technique as a preprocessing step for the classification of hyperspectral images.}
