  abstract = {Smart growth policy has been identified as a panacea to tackle a range of undesirable outcomes of sprawl development. Various neighbourhood planning concepts have been developed following smart growth principles such as transit oriented development, and infill development. Existing empirical studies, however, do not answer to a key policy question: can smart growth policies reduce the urban heat island (UHI) effect? If so, what type of smart growth policy would be most effective? This research examined the questions by deriving five alternative neighbourhood planning scenarios for Brisbane for 2023: a) business as usual, b) transit oriented development (TOD), c) infill development, d) motorway corridor oriented development, and e) sprawl development. The research utilises Landsat remote sensing images of 1991, 2004, and 2013 to: first, estimate and validate a Geographically Weighted Regression model in order to identify statistically significant factors influencing the UHI intensities in Brisbane; and second, predict the UHI intensities of the five policy scenarios. Two factors were identified to have significant influence on the UHI intensities in Brisbane: population density, and porosity. Results show that compared to the 2004 and 2013 levels, Brisbane will respectively experience a higher and lower levels of UHI effect in 2023, irrespective of the policy scenarios. On average, the infill development scenario, as a smart growth policy, has a marginally better potential to mitigate the UHI effect in Brisbane in 2023 compared to the sprawl development scenario conditional on the definition applied in this research. The UHI effect would be more equitably balanced spatially under the sprawl development scenario.},

  abstract = {It is now widely accepted that climate change is occurring as a result of the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere arising from the combustion of fossil fuels. Climate change may affect health through a range of pathways, for example as a result of increased frequency and intensity of heat waves, reduction in cold related deaths, increased floods and droughts, changes in the distribution of vector-borne diseases and effects on the risk of disasters and malnutrition. The overall balance of effects on health is likely to be negative and populations in low-income countries are likely to be particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects. The experience of the 2003 heat wave in Europe shows that high-income countries may also be adversely affected. Adaptation to climate change requires public health strategies and improved surveillance. Mitigation of climate change by reducing the use of fossil fuels and increasing a number of uses of the renewable energy technologies should improve health in the near-term by reducing exposure to air pollution.},

  abstract = {Abstract A new index of calculating the intensity of urban heat island effects (UHI) for a city using satellite skin temperature and land cover observations is recommended. UHI, the temperature difference between urban and rural regions, is traditionally identified from the 2-m surface air temperatures (i.e., the screen-level temperature T2m) measured at a pair of weather stations sited in urban and rural locations. However, such screen-level UHI is affected by the location, distance, and geographic conditions of the pair of weather stations. For example, choosing a different pair of rural and city sites leads to a different UHI intensity for the same city, due to the high heterogeneity of the urban surface temperature. To avoid such uncertainty, satellite-observed surface skin temperature measurements (i.e., skin level temperature Tskin) is recommended to record UHI, known as skin-level UHI or UHIskin. This new index has advantages of high spatial resolution and aerial coverage to better record UHI intensity than T2m. An assessment of skin-level UHI from 10 yr of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)’s Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observations reveals that skin-level UHI has a strong UHI signal during the day and at night. In addition, there are significant diurnal and seasonal variations in skin-level UHI. Furthermore, the skin-level UHI is stronger during the day and summer (July) than during nighttime and winter. This new index is important for more uniformly assessing UHIs over cities around the globe. Nevertheless, whether the seasonality and diurnal variations revealed in this work using skin-level UHI index are valid over desert cities, such as Phoenix, Arizona, need to be examined.},

The present paper aims to collect, analyze and present in a comparative way existing studies investigating the impact of ambient temperature increase on electricity consumption. Analysis of eleven studies dealing with the impact of the ambient temperature on the peak electricity demand showed that for each degree of temperature increase, the increase of the peak electricity load varies between 0.45\% and 4.6\%. This corresponds to an additional electricity penalty of about 21 (±10.4)W per degree of temperature increase and per person. In parallel, analysis of fifteen studies examining the impact of ambient temperature on the total electricity consumption, showed that the actual increase of the electricity demand per degree of temperature increase varies between 0.5\% and 8.5\%.},

  abstract = {Urban Heat Island (UHI) is a phenomenon that can cause hotspots in city areas due to dense, impervious infrastructure and minimal vegetation cover. UHI hotspots may become worse in extreme heat events that are already affecting many regions across the globe due to increased frequent hot extremes, human-induced warming in cities, and rapidly growing urbanization, as documented by the latest IPCC report 2021. In seeking to support designers, planners, and decision-makers in developing and implementing adaptation strategies and measures to make our cities sustainable and resilient, reliable projections and modelling are required. In this study, we modelled UHI vulnerability using high-resolution spatial data, advanced geospatial tools, and socio-demographic data. This modified vulnerability approach drew upon UHI index maps and 20 select customized indicators of heat exposure, population sensitivity, and mobility/adaptive capacity. The indicators were Delphi evaluated and weighted, and the methodology was applied against the City of Greater Geelong municipality in Australia. The resulting UHI index maps indicated significant hotspots in areas of high building density, commercial/industrial zones, newly constructed sites, and zones with low urban green infrastructure. These UHI maps, in combination with selected indicators, highlighted the areal concentration of heat risk areas and vulnerable locations for the sensitive human population. The highlighted areas were primarily concentrated in high building density and high population density areas, which was seen through correlation curves. However, the building density showed a weak correlation, and population per meshblock indicated a strong correlation with UHI measurements. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of risk mapping and vulnerability assessment using GIS geospatial data for the advancement of a major local government area and concludes that this methodology has replicability incomparable geographical regions.},

Such strategies also can lower the demand for air-conditioning-related energy production. Since local impacts of global climate change may be intensified in areas with UHIs, mitigation strategies could play an increasingly important role as individuals and communities adapt to climate change. We use CITYgreen, a GIS-based modeling application, to estimate the potential benefits of urban vegetation and reflective roofs as UHI mitigation strategies for case study sites in and around Newark and Camden, New Jersey. The analysis showed that urban vegetation can reduce health hazards associated with the UHI effect by removing pollutants from the air. Less affluent, inner-city neighborhoods are the ones in which the hazard potential of the UHI effect is shown to be greatest. However, these neighborhoods have less available open space for tree planting and therefore a lower maximum potential benefit. As the climate warms, these neighborhoods may face greater consequences due to interactions between the UHI effect and global climate change. Results also show that urban vegetation is an effective and economically efficient way to reduce energy consumption and costs at the sites.},

In urban regions, these future heat waves will be exacerbated by the urban heat island effect, and will have the potential to negatively influence the health and welfare of urban residents. In order to investigate the health effects of the urban heat island (UHI) in Shanghai, China, 30~years of meteorological records (1975–2004) were examined for 11 first- and second-order weather stations in and around Shanghai. Additionally, automatic weather observation data recorded in recent years as well as daily all-cause summer mortality counts in 11 urban, suburban, and exurban regions (1998–2004) in Shanghai have been used. The results show that different sites (city center or surroundings) have experienced different degrees of warming as a result of increasing urbanization. In turn, this has resulted in a more extensive urban heat island effect, causing additional hot days and heat waves in urban regions compared to rural locales. An examination of summer mortality rates in and around Shanghai yields heightened heat-related mortality in urban regions, and we conclude that the UHI is directly responsible, acting to worsen the adverse health effects from exposure to extreme thermal conditions.},

  abstract = {The energy balance differences between urban and rural areas give rise to a representative phenomenon of urban climate change called the urban heat island (UHI). The UHI phenomenon, which is exacerbated by global warming effects and urban expansion, exposes urban areas and populations to thermal stress and overheating. Therefore, measuring the intensity of UHI vulnerability is needed to mitigate its effects on health, comfort, energy consumption and infrastructure. Additionally, urban decision makers are looking for methodologies to identify the most vulnerable areas in urban planning. This research aims to investigate areas prone to urban overheating in Montpellier Mediterranean metropolitan area as a representative case study of the French urban planning context. The objective is to develop a methodology for assessing UHI vulnerability based on the interaction of exposure and sensitivity to urban planning policies. Accordingly, a set of fifteen indicators is developed to visualize urban planning policies, exposure and sensitivity to urban overheating. A statistical-based method is applied to determine the individual weights based on the indicators’ variance, which is calculated using principal component analysis (PCA). The spatial and urban planning distribution of vulnerability is then analyzed. The results indicate that the areas with the highest urban planning challenges are most vulnerable to UHI. In fact, the results reveal that these areas have urban planning characteristics likely to aggravate urban overheating. Therefore, this research proposes a methodology for integrating mitigation solutions into urban planning: increase in permeable and green areas; improvement of urban ventilation and heat exchange and decrease in anthropogenic heat generation. It demonstrates that combining urban planning policies with exposure and sensitivity is a new perspective for vulnerability studies. The findings of this study can be utilized by decision makers to better visualize areas susceptible to UHI and plan appropriate mitigation strategies.},
